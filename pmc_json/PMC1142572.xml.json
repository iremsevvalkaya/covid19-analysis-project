Despite concerns that SARS-CoV would re-emerge, last winter (2003\u20132004), only a handful of individuals were found infected by the virus. These individuals appeared to have much less severe symptoms, and no secondary transmission was observed (Liang et al, 2004; Peiris et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). Severe cases of SARS were also reported in 2004, but these resulted from laboratory infections (Normile, 2004).",

            "text": "The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates infection of receptor-bearing cells (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Holmes, 2003; Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and binds the SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity (Li et al, 2003). Several lines of evidence suggest that ACE2 is a physiologically relevant receptor during infection. Tissue expression of the receptor corresponds to the localization of virus in infected individuals and animals (Harmer et al, 2002; Chan et al, 2004; Ding et al, 2004; Hamming et al, 2004). Also, the efficiency of infection in humans, mice, and rats correlates with the ability of the ACE2 of each species to support viral replication (Li et al, 2004; Subbarao et al, 2004; Wentworth et al, 2004). Antibodies that block ACE2 association (Sui et al, 2004) protect mice against infection (Sui et al, 2005). Finally, although many cell lines do not express ACE2, most cell lines shown to support SARS-CoV infection or replication detectably express this receptor (Hofmann et al, 2004; Nie et al, 2004). Although DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN, CD209L) and DC-SIGN (CD209) have recently been shown to enhance infection of ACE2-expressing cells (Jeffers et al, 2004; Marzi et al, 2004; Yang et al, 2004), these proteins do not appear to mediate efficient infection in the absence of ACE2 (Jeffers et al, 2004; Marzi et al, 2004).",

However, two domains corresponding to the S1 and S2 proteins of processed coronaviruses can be defined (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The S1 domain mediates receptor association, whereas the S2 domain is membrane-associated and likely undergoes structural rearrangements that mediate membrane fusion. A discrete receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein has been defined at residues 318\u2013510 of the S1 domain (Xiao et al, 2003; Babcock et al, 2004; Wong et al, 2004). This RBD binds ACE2 with higher affinity than does the full S1 domain (Wong et al, 2004).",

Palm civets have also been implicated in the minor 2003\u20132004 SARS outbreak (Zhong, 2004). The sequences of the S-protein genes of 13 viruses isolated from palm civets, and one from raccoon dogs, have been determined (Guan et al, 2003; Song et al, 2005). Interestingly, the RBDs of these animal S proteins are highly conserved except residue 479, which varies between asparagine and basic amino acids, but differ at several positions from the RBDs of viruses isolated during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak. Although different from palm-civet-derived RBDs, the latter RBDs were themselves highly conserved in the more than 100 S-protein genes obtained during the severe human outbreak (He et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004). Full sequence has also been published for two S-protein genes obtained during the mild 2003\u20132004 outbreak (He et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). These genes are nearly identical and contain elements common to S protein isolated during the earlier human outbreak and to that isolated from palm civets.",

By introducing four residues of human ACE2 into rat ACE2, we convert this receptor, which supports little or no S-protein-mediated infection, into a receptor that binds the S1 domain and supports infection, with efficiency close to that of human ACE2. By characterizing additional ACE2 variants, we localize the S-protein-binding domain primarily to \u03b1-helix 1 of ACE2 and to a loop leading to \u03b2-sheet 5. We then show that a representative S protein from the mild 2003\u20132004 outbreak, and one from palm civets, mediates more efficient infection of cells expressing palm-civet ACE2 compared to cells expressing human receptor. In contrast, S protein from the severe 2002\u20132003 outbreak efficiently binds and utilizes both receptors. Two regions of the S-protein-binding site on ACE2, and two residues in the RBD of these S proteins, largely determine these differences. Our data describe S-protein adaptations, and their receptor counterparts, that permit efficient infection of human cells. These adaptations, absolutely conserved during 2002\u20132003 outbreak, may in part account for the unusual severity of SARS.",

The latter domain is defined by its close homology with a small, kidney-expressed protein of the same name (Zhang et al, 2001). Figure 1A shows that a fusion protein comprising the SARS-CoV S1 domain and the Fc domain of human IgG1 (S1-Ig) efficiently precipitated human ACE2, as well as an ACE2 chimera with the human catalytic domain and the rat collectrin domain. In contrast, S1-Ig could not precipitate rat ACE2 or an ACE2 chimera with the rat catalytic domain and the human collectrin domain. The ability of these chimeric receptors to bind S1-Ig was also reflected in their ability to support S-protein-mediated infection (Figure 2C). These data indicate that differences in the ability of rat and human ACE2 to support infection are localized to the catalytic domain of the receptor.",

Two variants consistently bound S1-Ig less efficiently than did wild-type human ACE2. Introduction of rat residues 82\u201384 (NFS), which include a glycosylation site at asparagine 82 not present in human ACE2, partially inhibited S1-Ig association (Figures 1B and 2A) and S-protein-mediated entry (Figure 2C). Alteration of lysine 353 to a histidine residue present on the rat receptor interfered more dramatically with S1-Ig association, and also partially inhibited S-protein-mediated entry. Introduction of human residues 82\u201384 (MYP) and lysine 353 into rat ACE2 resulted in substantial increases in S1-Ig binding, as assayed both by immunoprecipitation and by flow cytometry (Figure 2A and B). Combination of both sets of residues resulted in a rat ACE2 variant that bound S1-Ig and supported S-protein-mediated infection comparably to human ACE2 (Figure 2A\u2013C).

These two conformations likely reflect free and substrate-bound states of the enzyme, respectively. We investigated whether the large conformational change associated with inhibitor binding interfered with S1-Ig binding or S-protein-mediated infection. As previously reported, MLN-4760 inhibits ACE2 activity in the low nanomolar range (Dales et al, 2002), and no ACE2 enzymatic activity was detected in the presence of 100 nM inhibitor (Figure 4A). However, 100 nM MLN-4760 did not interfere with immunoprecipitation of ACE2 by S1-Ig, nor did this inhibitor interfere with S-protein-mediated infection (Figure 4B and C). Consistent with these observations, the distances among \u03b1 and \u03b2 carbons of residues 31, 41, 353, 355, and 357 in the S-protein-binding site of ACE2 varied by less than 0.4 \u00c5 between the inhibitor-bound and -unbound structures (Towler et al, 2004). In contrast, distances between these residues and residues across the cleft typically varied by greater than 6 \u00c5 in the two structures. These data suggest that the S-protein-binding region of ACE2 is not perturbed by inhibitors or substrates that induce large conformational changes in the receptor. Consistent with these studies, we have also observed, using the assay shown in Figure 4A, that S1-Ig does not interfere with the enzymatic activity of ACE2 (data not shown).",

Another outbreak, during the winter of 2003\u20132004, caused much less severe symptoms in the few individuals infected and resulted in no documented human-to-human transmissions (He et al, 2004; Liang et al, 2004; Zhong, 2004; Song et al, 2005). We compared an S protein of virus isolated during this latter outbreak (GD03T0013; accession number AY525636; denoted GD herein) with that of virus obtained during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak (TOR2; AY274119) and with that isolated from palm civets (SZ3; AY304486) (Guan et al, 2003; Marra et al, 2003; Rota et al, 2003; He et al, 2004; Song et al, 2005). Figure 5A shows that the S1 domains of all three S proteins efficiently bound palm-civet ACE2 (accession number AY881174), whereas only the S1 domain of TOR2 efficiently bound human ACE2. Of note, the S1 domain of virus isolated during the 2003\u20132004 outbreak bound palm-civet ACE2 much more efficiently than it bound human ACE2. We then investigated the RBD of each of these S-protein variants. The ability of these S1 domains to bind palm-civet and human ACE2 was reflected in the ability of their respective RBDs to bind these receptors (Figure 5B). We also assayed the ability of the entire S protein to mediate infection of cells expressing human or palm-civet ACE2. The efficiency of entry was consistent with the ability of the S1 domain of each variant to bind each ACE2 (Figure 6C). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the palm civet is a source of SARS-CoV, and suggest that the apparent lack of severity of disease during the 2003\u20132004 outbreak may be due in part to incomplete adaptation of GD virus to human ACE2.",

Each residue in the TOR2 RBD was altered to its SZ3 counterpart. Alteration of two residues, at positions 479 and 487, interfered with the association of the TOR2 RBD with human ACE2 (Figure 6B). Surface plasmon resonance studies further demonstrated a greater than 20-fold decrease of affinity for human ACE2 when either residue 479 or 487, but not when residue 344 or 360, is altered to its palm-civet counterpart (Table I and Supplementary Figure 2). Notably, alteration of threonine 487 to serine also affected the ability of the TOR2 RBD to associate with palm-civet ACE2 (Figure 6B). Introduction of TOR2 residues at 479 or 487 substantially increased the ability of the full SZ3 S protein to infect cells expressing human ACE2. Introduction of SZ3 residues at these positions into the TOR2 S protein resulted in a 2- to 3-fold decrease in infection of these cells (Figure 6C). These data suggest that adaptation of S protein to human ACE2 is facilitated by alteration of residue 479 to asparagine and of 487 to threonine.",

Two regions within the S-protein-binding site differed significantly between human and palm-civet ACE2 (see Figure 7D and E). A region of \u03b1-helix 1 (residues 30\u201340) varied at six residues between human and civet ACE2. Likewise, a loop initiating ACE2 \u03b1-helix 3 differed by four residues (90\u201393). A glycosylation site at asparagine 90 of human ACE2 is part of this latter region and is not present in palm-civet ACE2. Figure 7A shows that the S1 domains of GD and SZ3 bound substantially more efficiently when either of these regions was introduced into human ACE2, and that introduction of both regions resulted in receptor binding comparable to that with wild-type palm-civet ACE2. These observations were also reproduced in infection assays (Figure 7B). These data demonstrate that residues within the S-protein-binding domain of ACE2 largely determine the efficiency with which GD and SZ3 S proteins bind and utilize human and palm-civet ACE2.",

            "text": "Figure 7C compares the ability of eight RBD variants to bind to human and civet ACE2, as well as to the chimeric molecules assayed in Figure 7A and to a point-mutation variant of palm-civet ACE2, in which aspartic acid 354 was altered to a glycine present in human ACE2. RBD variants were generated from that of TOR2 (left panels) or SZ3 (right panels), and altered at positions 479, 487, or both, as indicated. The panels of Figure 7C permit several conclusions. First, the rough equivalence between the left and right panels indicates that, as implied by Figure 6B and C, S-protein residues 479 and 487 account for most of the differences between TOR2 and SZ3 RBD. Second, no consistent differences were observed between palm-civet ACE2 and its variant with glycine at residue 354, indicating little or no contribution of this residue to S-protein association. Third, consistent with infection data in Figure 6C, the presence of threonine at residue 487 enhanced the affinity of most RBDs for civet and human ACE2, and for variants of these receptors. (Compare, for example, K479/S487 RBD variants with K479/T487 variants for their ability to precipitate each ACE2 variant.) Fourth, and in contrast, substitution of lysine 479 for asparagine in most contexts increased the ability of each RBD variant to associate with human, but not with palm-civet, ACE2. (Compare the binding of N479/T487 RBD with that of K479/T487 variants for binding to human ACE2 (lane 1) and palm-civet ACE2 (lane 6); likewise for N479/S487 and K479/S487 variants.) This enhancement was also observed for ACE2 chimeras containing human \u03b1-helix 1 residues (lanes 1 and 2), but not those of palm civet (lanes 3, 5, and 6), whereas residues 90\u201393 did not determine sensitivity to RBD residue 479. Fifth, consistent with infection data in Figure 7B and Supplementary Figure 3, all RBDs bound ACE2 variants bearing residues 90\u201393 of palm-civet ACE2 substantially more efficiently than they bound equivalent variants with human ACE2 residues at these positions (compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4 in each panel). Thus, the data of Figure 7C indicate that a lysine at S-protein residue 479 interferes with RBD association with human, but not palm-civet, ACE2. Supplementary Figure 4 shows data consistent with a steric interaction between lysine 31 of human ACE2 and lysine 479 of the SZ3 S protein. Our data also show that alteration of S-protein serine 487 to threonine increases RBD affinity for both human and civet ACE2. Finally, they suggest that no S protein studied has fully adapted to human ACE2 residues 90\u201393, consistent with a recent zoonotic transmission of the virus.",

Here we describe the S-protein-binding domain of ACE2. In particular, residues along the first \u03b1-helix, and lysine 353 and proximal residues at the N-terminus of \u03b2-sheet 5, participate in S-protein binding and in infection. By altering histidine 353 in rat ACE2 and modifying a glyosylation site that may alter the shape of \u03b1-helix 1, we converted rat ACE2 to an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV. This S-protein-binding region of ACE2 remains intact in the presence of an inhibitor that dramatically alters the overall conformation of ACE2 (Dales et al, 2002; Towler et al, 2004), consistent with the inability of this inhibitor to block infection, and with the inability of the S protein to modulate ACE2 activity.",

We have shown that entry is the primary barrier to SARS-CoV infection of murine cells (Li et al, 2004). These observations suggest that S-protein changes may be critical to or sufficient for the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human cells. Accordingly, we compared the S proteins derived from the 2002\u20132003 outbreak (TOR2), from the less severe 2003\u20132004 outbreak (GD), and from apparently healthy palm civets (SZ3) (Guan et al, 2003; He et al, 2004). Strikingly, the receptor-binding regions of each of these S proteins bound palm-civet ACE2 efficiently, but only that from the 2002\u20132003 outbreak bound human ACE2 with comparable efficiency. These data are consistent with the absence of human-to-human transmission during the 2003\u20132004 outbreak, and with recent transmission of SARS-CoV from palm civets to humans (Guan et al, 2003; Zhong, 2004; Song et al, 2005).",

Knowledge of these residues may be useful in assessing the risk posed by any new SARS-CoV outbreak. Our data also show that, even with these and other changes outside the RBD, SARS-CoV is imperfectly adapted to its human receptor. In particular, introduction of residues 90\u201393 of civet ACE2 into the human receptor increased binding of, and infection mediated by, all S proteins assayed. This effect may be due to removal of a glycosylation site at position 90 to which no SARS-CoV has fully adapted.

The lower affinity of palm-civet-derived S protein for the palm-civet receptor is consistent with this pattern in that no overt disease was manifest in animals from which this virus was isolated (Guan et al, 2003), but disease was observed in palm civets challenged with isolates obtained during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak (Wu et al, 2005).
