Only three viruses are known to cause disease: CCHFV, Dugbe virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus. CCHFV is an arthropod-borne pathogen and the causative agent of a serious form of hemorrhagic fever [7-9] with mortality rates ranging from 15 to 60% [10-17]. The virus is endemic in parts of Africa, Southeastern Europe and Asia as far east as western China [16,18,19]. The geographic distribution of CCHFV infections corresponds most closely with the distribution of Hyalomma ticks, suggesting their principal vector role [18,20,21]. Hyalomma ticks normally feed on a variety of livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, and ostriches), large wild herbivores, hares, and hedgehogs, which can become infected with CCHFV [13,18,22,23]. In contrast to human infections, infection in these animals generally results in inapparent or subclinical disease but generates viremia levels capable of supporting virus transmission to uninfected ticks [10,18,21,23-25]. Transmission to humans occurs either by bites from infected ticks or direct contact with blood or tissues of infected livestock. Nosocomial infections are common [26] and represent a major problem in health care institutions [27].",

Since the C-terminus of CCHFV GN has not yet been determined ([28]; S. Nichol: pers. communication) two constructs were generated containing an N-terminal Influenza HA-tag for detection: pCMV CCHF GN \"short\" (GNs) and pCMV CCHF GN \"long\" (GNl). Glycoprotein expression was first analyzed by immunoblot using CCHFV-specific polyclonal or HA-tag antibodies. The CCHF full-length glycoprotein precursor construct (pCAGGS CCHFV GPC) was successfully expressed and correctly processed into the cleavage fragments GC and GN (Fig. 2, lane 2). Molecular weights (GC, 37 kDa and GN, 75 kDa) as determined by immunoblot analysis were in accordance with those of the GC and GN expressed in CCHFV-infected VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). CMV-driven HA-GNs and HA-GNl expression resulted in a protein of approximately 75 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), similar to authentic GN glycoprotein seen in CCHFV-infected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). Expression of chicken \u03b2-actin-driven GC resulted in a product of approximately 37 kDa, again similar to GC expression in CCHV-infected cells (Fig. 2, lane 5). The data demonstrates that each glycoprotein can be authentically expressed individually from separate plasmids (e.g., pCMV GNs, pCMV GNl and pCAGGS GC) as well as from a clone encoding the GPC precursor (pCAGGS GPC) using polyclonal CCHFV-specific and HA-tag antibodies (Fig. 2). Expression could also be confirmed using CCHFV-specific GC and GN antipeptide antibodies which were kindly provided by S. Nichol, CDC) (data not shown).",

Intracellular staining pattern of CCHV-infected cells as well as cells expressing the CCHFV precursor GPC revealed a Golgi complex staining pattern independent of the antibodies used for detection of the individual glycoproteins (Fig. 3A: d, e, i, j). Subsequently, we analyzed the intracellular localization of individually expressed GN and GC. Whereas individually expressed GN showed a Golgi complex localization (Fig. 3A: b, c, g, h), individually expressed GC accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell indicative of ER localization (Fig. 3A: a, f). Confirmation for these results were achieved by co-immunofluorescence analyzed on a confocal microscope using CCHFV glycoprotein-specific or HA-specific antibodies and either antibodies directed against the ER-specific marker molecule calreticulin or direct staining of the Golgi region with BODIPY-TR C5 ceramides (Fig. 4). Again, CCHFV GN expression from the two expression plasmids pCMV GNs and pCMV GNl overlapped with Golgi staining (Fig. 4: e, f), whereas GC expression overlapped with that of calreticulin (Fig. 4: d). However, co-expression of both CCHFV glycoproteins either from the glycoprotein precursor plasmid or from simultaneous transfection of the two expression plasmids resulted in Golgi targeting of both glycoproteins (Fig. 4: c, g) strongly indicating that GN drives the Golgi localization and that GC needs to interact with GN in order to be transported out of the ER.",

For this, we generated GFP-fusion proteins containing different fragments of the GC or GN proteins attached to GFP. On the basis of published data obtained with other bunyaviruses we expected Golgi localization signals rather within the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains than in the ectodomain [3,4]. A CMV-driven GFP expression plasmid (pHL2823, Flick and Hobom, unpublished) was used as a cloning vector for fusing different regions of the CCHFV glycoproteins to the C-terminus of the GFP. Firstly, the different PCR-amplified GN cytoplasmic domain fragments (Table 2) were cleaved with BsmBI and inserted into pHL2823 after BamHI/XbaI endonuclease treatment. In an alternative approach a signal peptide (Ig \u03ba-chain signal of the pDisplay vector) was fused to the GFP N-terminus to allow entry into the secretory pathway. Secondly, the GN transmembrane domain (TM I) was inserted using a hybridized oligonucleotide linker (RF372/RF373: GATCCTTTGGCTATGT AATAACCTGCATACTTTGCAAGGCCATTTTTTACTTGTTAATAATTGTTGGATAAT/ CTAGATTATCCAACAATTATTAACAAGTAAAAAATGGCCTTGCAAAGTATGCAGGTTATTACATAGCCAAAG).

All constructs expressed GFP-fusion proteins of expected sizes and were subsequently used in co-localization studies.

GFP-GNA contains the first 87 amino acids from the cytoplasmic domain including the RKLL motif at position 808, which is a predicted protease cleavage motif for generating the C-terminus of the mature GN protein, whereas GFP-GNB has 99 amino acids fused to the GFP C-terminus, corresponding to the first GN cytosolic tail fragment, which is followed by a second hydrophobic region predicted as a potential transmembrane domain 2 (TM II) (compare Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the fusion proteins GFP-GNC, GFP-GND, GFP-GNE, GFP-GNF, GFP-GNG, and GFP-GNH, which contain longer fragments of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain including additional predicted hydrophobic transmembran regions (Fig. 6A), showed an increased level of similarity to the intracellular pattern of GNl, which contained the entire GN cytoplasmic domain up to the determined mature GC start (Figs. 6B and 6C: e-j). The switch from a diffuse staining pattern to a Golgi complex localization is caused by the addition of TM II to the first 99 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain resulting in GFP-fusion proteins containing 122 amino acids of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6A). These results demonstrate that the Golgi targeting signal is not located within the first 99 amino acids of the GN cytoplasmic domain. However, the addition of an additional hydrophobic 23 amino acid stretch (TM II) result in a co-localization of the GFP-fusion protein with the Golgi complex marker mannosidase II (Fig. 7), demonstrating that a Golgi localization signal is located within the predicted TM II.",

For this, membrane-associated cellular proteins were separated from soluble proteins and the different fractions analyzed via immunoblot using GFP-specific antibodies. As expected, constructs GFP GNI, GFP GNA, and GFP GNB, containing only the TM I, 87 or 99 amino acids from the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain, respectively, were only detected in the soluble fraction (Fig. 8a; only shown for GNB), whereas GFP GNC and constructs with longer parts from the GN cytoplasmic domain including the TM II region were detected mainly in the pellet fraction containing membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 8b). Constructs with longer fragments of the GN cytoplasmic domain, including additional TM regions, were exclusively detected within the pellet fraction (e.g., GFP GNG; Fig. 8c). These results confirmed our previous findings that the addition of GN TM II results in a change of intracellular protein localization and seems to mediate targeting to Golgi membranes.",

However, so far no common motifs could be identified for signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins resulting in Golgi targeting and accumulation. Indeed, even the locations of such signals within bunyaviral glycoproteins are different. For the phlebovirus Uukuniemi (UUK), a Golgi retention signal could be identified within the membrane-proximal half (aa1040) of the 81 aa long cytoplasmic domain of GN [30,31,38]. In contrast, for the phlebovirus Punto Toro, such signals were mapped to the transmembrane domain (TM) and the adjacent amino acids of the GN cytoplasmic domain [36,37]. A similar localization was recently described for the Golgi retention signal in the GN of the phlebovirus Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus GN [34]. Notable, for the Old World hantavirus Hantaan (HTN) it was reported that the conformation of the GN/GC complex might play a more important role for Golgi accumulation than an actual primary sequence motif [39].",

Here we demonstrated, for the first time, that the CCHFV GN protein is membrane associated and contains a Golgi localization motif. In addition we have mapped this signal to a hydrophobic region (TM II) within the predicted cytoplasmic tail [5]. Co-expressed GN and GC result in a specific Golgi accumulation and co-localization using specific Golgi markers, whereas individual expressed GC is retained in the ER. These results imply that the two CCHFV glycoproteins have to interact and form hetero-oligomers for a proper Golgi transport of GC.",

Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the addition of only the hydrophobic region from the predicted TM II within the GN cytoplasmic domain targeted a GFP-fusion protein to the Golgi complex.

IFA data combined with confocal microscopy co-localization studies of cells transfected with GNs expression plasmids demonstrated a clear Golgi complex staining (Fig. 3A: b, g; Fig. 4e). Since GNs contains only the first 87 amino acids of the predicted cytoplasmic domain without the predicted TM II sequence, we expected that the corresponding GFP-fusion protein GFP-GNA would show similar intracellular localization. However, the diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm of transfected cells demonstrates that the first 87 amino acids are not sufficient to target the GFP to the Golgi complex (GFP-GNA; Figs. 6B and 6C: c). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the existence of a second Golgi localization signal located within the GN ectodomain. Such a signal would be the reason for the Golgi localization pattern of GNs, whereas GFP-GNC and fusion proteins containing longer fragments of the predicted GN cytoplasmic domain localize to the Golgi region because of a Golgi localization signal located in TM II.",

In case of single expressed GC protein this signal is most likely responsible for the ER localization of the protein, even though GFP-CCHF GCA fusion proteins containing only the predicted TM showed perinuclear staining pattern (Figs. 6B and 6C: m). However, co-expression with GN protein leads to interaction between these two proteins most likely resulting in masking of the ER retrieval signal and an accumulation of the heterodimer in the Golgi complex, due to the Golgi retention signal(s) located on GN (Fig. 3A: d, e, i, j; Fig. 4g).

At 24 to 48 h post transfection, supernatant was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS followed by an additional washing step with 100 ml NaCl. Occasionally, the transfected cells would detach from the plate thus, the non-adherent cells were isolated between washes by microcentrifugation (2 min at 1000 \u00d7 g). Remaining cells were scraped (adherent) or resuspended (non-adherent) into 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.5 and homogenized (five strokes) in a 2 ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then incubated for 30 min on ice and 1 ml of sodium carbonate was added to attain the necessary volume for subsequent ultracentrifugation (2 ml). The homogenate was then centrifuged for 60 min at 50.000 rpm using a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman) at 4\u00b0C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and concentrated three to five times. The pellet was resuspended in 250 \u03bcl of sodium carbonate.
