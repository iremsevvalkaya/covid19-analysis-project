            "text": "Most double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages evolve a highly specialized tail that is crucial to infection and is composed of numerous copies of proteins (Brussow and Hendrix, 2002). These tailed phages form the order of Caudovirales and are classified into three families based on tail morphology: Myoviridae, which have a long contractile tail; Siphoviridae, which have a long but noncontractile tail; and Podoviridae, which have a short tail (Ackermann, 1998). Bacteriophage P22, one of the prototypes in Podoviridae, is characterized by a short tail structure incorporated into a unique five-fold vertex of the icosahedral phage capsid (Poteete, 1994). This tail structure is a molecular machine that consists of multiple protein components with a total mass over 2.8 million Daltons and integrates various biological functions that are critical to the assembly and infection of the phage (Table I). The assembly of the tail machine is initiated by incorporation of the portal protein into one vertex of the procapsid during procapsid assembly together with several copies of each of three minor proteins (Bazinet et al, 1988). The minor proteins and the portal complex are required for infectivity but not for procapsid assembly (Botstein et al, 1973). The portal forms a ring that provides a conduit for DNA entry during phage assembly and DNA exit during infection (Bazinet and King, 1985), as in many other dsDNA phages and some eukaryotic viruses such as herpesvirus (Newcomb et al, 2001; Sheaffer et al, 2001; Dittmer and Bogner, 2005). Upon completion of DNA packaging, proteins gp4, gp10 and gp26 are attached to the portal to form a slender substructure, which stabilizes the packaged DNA by preventing it from leaking out of the capsid (King et al, 1973; Lenk et al, 1975; Strauss and King, 1984). In the last step of phage assembly, tailspikes are attached. The tailspike protein, a homotrimer of 72 kDa subunits, is anchored by its N-terminal head-binding domain in a noncovalent but irreversible manner (Berget and Poteete, 1980; Maurides et al, 1990). The C-terminal receptor-binding domain of the tailspike recognizes and cleaves the O-antigenic repeating units of lipopolysaccharide on the cell surface of Salmonella bacteria (Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976). This is followed by the injection of the phage DNA through the tail into the host cytoplasm.",

            "text": "The structure and assembly of the capsid of P22 as well as many other bacterial and eukaryotic dsDNA viruses have been studied extensively (Stewart et al, 1991; Wikoff et al, 2000; Zhou et al, 2000; Conway et al, 2001; Grunewald et al, 2003; Heymann et al, 2003; Jiang et al, 2003; Rixon and Chiu, 2003; Abrescia et al, 2004; Fokine et al, 2004). However, the current knowledge about the detailed architecture of the tail in dsDNA bacteriophage has been scarce, and is largely limited to the case of T4, a bacteriophage of Myoviridae family that infects Escherichia coli. Large-scale rearrangement of protein subunits was observed by comparison of the structures of the noncontracted and contracted tails of T4 (Kostyuchenko et al, 2003; Leiman et al, 2004). The electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structure of Bacillus phage SPP1 portal in complex with head completion proteins gp15 and gp16, through which the tail is connected to the head, revealed local conformational change of the portal upon binding of gp15 and the function of gp16 as a valve (Orlova et al, 2003). Here, we present the three-dimensional structures of the tail machine and a C-terminally truncated form of the portal protein of bacteriophage P22 determined by cryoEM and image reconstruction. Combining data of biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, cryoEM and genomics sources, we have located the five protein components in this elegant molecular machine. The structures indicate novel functions of component proteins that were not recognized previously, and provided insights into the biological functions of the tail machine as a whole.",

The low density in the middle of the hub indicates the presence of a channel. There is a small piece of high density at the center or near the edge of the hub, which could be the axial projection of a rod-like substructure. This is more clearly visible in the class average of the images (Figure 1A). The particles have preferential orientation in the vitrified ice. That is, virtually all the particles are oriented in such a way that the central channel is perpendicular to the ice plane. To overcome the problem in three-dimensional reconstruction owing to the preferential orientation, we took series of micrographs by tilting the grids through various angles up to 60\u00b0 (Figure 1B and C). An initial model was built manually by addition of six cylindrical density elements and a small spherical density to the reconstruction of the isolated truncated portal (see below). The final reconstruction was computed with 11 329 particles from tilted micrographs. The elongated needle-like density arising from the spherical one in the original map served as a validation for the reconstruction.",

The cryoEM structure shows a ring-like morphology shared by portals of phi29, SPP1, T3 and herpes simplex virus (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Orlova et al, 2003; Trus et al, 2004) (Figure 2A and B). The crown, wing and stalk domains are discernible (Figure 2B). The crown and wing domains are connected by thin density, implying plausible dynamics in terms of relative orientation/position between these two domains, which might be required for the regulatory role of the crown domain during DNA packaging and/or ejection (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Orlova et al, 2003). The diameter of the portal channel varies with the narrowest 35 \u00c5 at the bottom opening and 40 \u00c5 at the top opening. The maximal diameter of the channel is \u223c70 \u00c5 below the crown domains, creating a hollow space inside the portal complex. The X-ray structure of phi29 portal shows a channel of 36 \u00c5 at the bottom opening, which widens up to \u223c60 \u00c5 at the top opening. However, residues 231\u2013244 that were not visible in the structure of phi29 portal presumably point inward from the channel wall, and could occupy a position similar to that of the P22 portal crown domain, which would limit the actual inner diameter of the channel. In contrast, the channel of the SPP1 portal has a relatively constant diameter as was shown in a cryoEM reconstruction (Orlova et al, 2003). Hence, assuming that a B-form DNA passes through this channel, two contact sites would be present in P22 portal involving the crown domain and the distal end of the stalk domain, respectively, whereas the DNA\u2013portal interactions in SPP1 portal would be more evenly distributed over the whole channel. The truncated C-terminal 122 residues are most likely situated above the crown domain on the outer surface of the portal assembly, which is consistent with the fact that the C-terminal His tag is accessible to the Ni column during purification of the tail machine (see Materials and methods).",

The stalk domain has an elongated shape, and the long axis is skewed by \u223c25\u00b0 with respect to the 12-fold rotational axis. The X-ray structure of the phi29 portal was docked into the cryoEM map of the P22 portal (Figure 2C) (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002). The elongated density of the stalk domain in the P22 portal fits well with the coordinates of the characteristic long \u03b1 helices (residues 130\u2013155 and 206\u2013225) in phi29 portal (Guasch et al, 2002). This similarity in stalk domain orientation implies a common mechanical role in the DNA packaging molecular motor (Simpson et al, 2000; Guasch et al, 2002; Serwer, 2003). On the other hand, differences in the size and local structure of the other two domains correspond to more diverse regulatory functions, such as sensing and signaling during DNA packaging and ejection, and interactions with other proteins in the phage (Casjens et al, 1992; Molineux, 2001; Isidro et al, 2004).",

The atomic structures of the C-terminal receptor-binding domain and the N-terminal head-binding domain of the tailspike gp9 were determined at high resolution (Steinbacher et al, 1996, 1997), whereas X-ray structures of other protein components are lacking. Combination with genetic and biochemical data as well as the cryoEM reconstruction of the isolated P22 portal has allowed us to localize the five-component proteins in the three-dimensional map of the tail machine. The upper major part of the tail machine is a tube with a channel of 43 \u00c5 diameter in the middle (Figures 3 and 4A), which is presumably the conduit for viral DNA entry during packaging and exit during infection. The diameter of the channel varies from 113 \u00c5 at the top opening, to the narrowest 43 \u00c5, and 52 \u00c5 at the distal end (Figure 4A). The outer diameter of the tube ranges from 80 \u00c5 for the bottom end to 164 \u00c5 for the top wider end. The upper portion of this tube is assigned as the portal and the lower portion as gp4 and gp10. Attached to the lower half of the tube are six elongated appendages, each of which is a trimer of the tailspike protein gp9. The bottom opening of the tube is plugged by a 218 \u00c5 long needle-like density, which is coaxial with the tube. This needle has been interpreted as gp26.",

The orientation of the head-binding domain trimer about its internal three-fold axis is somewhat arbitrary. However, the intratrimeric rotational three-fold axes of the head-binding domains and of the receptor-binding domains intersect at 20\u00b0. In addition, the three-fold axis of the head-binding domains points outward by 18\u00b0 away from the global six-fold axis of the tail machine, and that of the receptor-binding domains inclines by 8\u00b0 when viewed from tailspike toward the global six-fold axis. This misorientation between the two domains is allowed by the flexible linkage near residues 100\u2013120 between the two domains (Steinbacher et al, 1997). It is not clear what force holds these two domains into the current conformation. Nevertheless, the current structure may represent a closed conformation. Upon host cell attachment, the receptor-binding domains bind to the lipopolysaccharide and may spread out like a blooming flower so that the bottom opening of the channel in the tail tube is closer, and therefore has easier access, to the host cell membrane.",

This suggests that binding of tailspike on the tail tube involves the interface formed by two head-binding domains. In fact, an Asp100Asn mutation that disrupted the interface between head-binding domains decreased the affinity of the tailspike to the tail tube to 1% of the wild-type tailspike (Schwarz and Berget, 1989; Steinbacher et al, 1997). This large contact area and plausible large conformational change in the local structure of the head-binding domain polypeptides could explain the noncovalent but irreversible binding of the tailspike (Berget and Poteete, 1980; Maurides et al, 1990). We propose that the tailspike-binding site on the tail tube is located on the interface of the two tail tube proteins gp4 and gp10, as gp10 is required for attachment of the tailspike (Strauss and King, 1984), and the mass of gp4 and gp10 implies that the molecular boundary between them crosses the tailspike-binding site (see below).",

Binding of gp10 requires binding of gp4, whereas gp4 is able to bind to the phage head without the presence of gp10 (Strauss and King, 1984). Therefore, the middle and the lower parts of the tail tube are accounted for by gp4 and gp10, respectively (Figure 4). Genomics data of P22-like phages revealed as high as 93% amino-acid sequence identity for gp10 (Casjens et al, 2004). Interestingly, high identity was detected for the N-terminal 48, 77 and 115 residues of gp4, gp26 and gp9, respectively, with their putative homologs, whereas the other portions of these proteins show considerably lower identity (Casjens et al, 2004). These data support the role of gp10 as a molecular junction in the tail assembly of P22-like phages. That is, gp10 serves as a common platform for binding of the N-terminal domains from gp4, gp26 and tailspike. The variable C-terminal domain of gp4, gp26 and tailspike either binds to the portal or performs respective biological functions that are related to phage/host specificity.",

            "text": "We have extracted the putative density for gp4 and gp10 by computationally subtracting the density for the tailspike, the needle and the portal. The resultant density predicts a molecular mass of 521 kDa, when the map is contoured at a level that is used for the whole tail machine map to yield 100% mass. This value is in good agreement with the mass of a gp10 hexamer and a gp4 12-mer, which is 531 kDa. Therefore, we infer that gp4 and gp10 are present in the tail assembly as a 12-mer and hexamer, respectively. In fact, the cryoEM map clearly shows six protrusions at the bottom end of the tail tube, and the density distribution in horizontal sections shows six peaks (Figures 3, 4B and D). In contrast, gp4 has more contiguous density. In phage T4, gp13, gp14, gp15 and gp3 form a neck region that connects the tail to the portal, and both gp13 and gp14 are dodecameric, whereas gp15 and gp3 appears to be hexameric (Leiman et al, 2004). The cryoEM structure of SPP1 connector with the head completion proteins gp15 and gp16 showed that gp15 and gp16 are both dodecameric (Orlova et al, 2003). Gp4 appears as a nut that fits around a bolt formed by the distal end of the portal (Figures 4A and 6), in sharp contrast to the SPP1 connector where the portal slightly encompasses gp15 (Orlova et al, 2003). Taking into consideration the molecular mass of the two proteins (Table I), a putative line of the boundary between gp4 and gp10 can be drawn, and this line turns out to be within the tailspike-binding site (Figure 4). Thus, the interface between gp4 and gp10 provides the binding site for the tailspike. This ensures that gp4 and gp10 together form only six sites for tailspike binding, although gp4 is a 12-mer, as it would create irregular binding patterns other than the normal six-fold binding of tailspike if 12 binding sites were present. This is consistent with the highly homogeneous hexavalent binding of the tailspike in the tail assembly in the experimental preparation.",

We assigned this needle density to gp26 based on several lines of evidence. First, gp26 is required for preventing packaged DNA from leaking out of the capsid, and was proposed to be the last protein in the sequential assembly of the tail (Israel, 1977; Strauss and King, 1984). Lack or mutation of gp4 and gp10 blocks attachment of gp26 (Strauss and King, 1984). Second, sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction show two long helices characterized by multiple heptad repeats, which implies that this protein folds as a trimeric coiled coil (Figure 5). This structural motif was observed in the C-terminal 119 residues of fibritin that forms the whiskers of phage T4 (Tao et al, 1997), and type I membrane fusion proteins in many enveloped viruses such as hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Gamblin et al, 2004; Stevens et al, 2004) and spike proteins in coronavirus (Xu et al, 2004). The length of the predicted long helix composed of \u223c100 residues would be 150 \u00c5, which fits well with the overall length of the needle taking into consideration that the remaining residues form domain structures near the N- and C-termini. The trimerization of heterologously expressed and purified gp26 in solution was observed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis (Andrews et al, 2005). Third, genetic mosaicism studies suggested that gp10 serve as a common platform for binding of the N-terminal domains from gp4, gp26 and gp9 with homology among P22-like phages (see the previous section). We postulate that the N-terminal proximity of gp26 is involved in binding with gp10, and most likely forms a subdomain to interact with the bottom tip of gp10. The cryoEM map shows slender but clear density between the top of gp26 and the bottom tip of gp10, and this interaction holds gp26 in the present conformation (Figure 4D).",

            "text": "Early work on P22 indicated that gp26 was the last in the three accessory proteins to be attached to the tail (Strauss and King, 1984). The location of gp26 appears to support a long-standing thought that it acted as a plug to prevent the packaged DNA from leaking. In Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1, there is no counterpart of gp26 and the role of a plug is played by a portion of accessory protein gp16, which forms a seal near the distal end of the connector and blocks the channel (Orlova et al, 2003). Interestingly, the length of 214 \u00c5 places gp26 at the forefront when the phage interacts with the host cell. Considering the position of lipopolysaccharide on the cell surface where the tailspikes are bound, the bottom tip of the gp26 needle could be deeply inserted into the outer membrane, and reach the peptidoglycan and even the inner membrane. Given the rigid nature of the triple-helical coiled-coil motif, a natural thought is that gp26 could serve as a mechanism for perturbation of the host cell outer membrane, if not as a cell-puncturing device such as that in T4 (Kanamaru et al, 2002), which in turn allows DNA translocation across the cell membrane. The contact of gp26 with the host cell outer membrane and/or peptidoglycan may physically strip it off the gp10. Indeed, gp26 was among the ejection proteins that were released from the phage virion after host cell attachment (Israel, 1977). The release of gp26 may produce a signal to be transduced through gp10, gp4 and the portal into the interior of the phage head, and trigger the phage DNA translocation.",

            "text": "The molecular anatomy described above allows us to structurally understand the assembly of the P22 tail machine (Figure 6). Upon DNA packaging and terminase dissociation, gp4, gp10, gp26 and gp9 are attached in a precisely controlled order (Strauss and King, 1984). The structure of the tail machine illustrates an organization of multiple proteins governed through a variety of symmetry relationships (Figure 6). The ring-like dodecameric portal is located at one of the 12 five-fold vertices of the phage head, which is the first symmetry transition in the phage assembly. The accessory proteins gp4 and gp10 are attached to the portal to form a cylindrical tube with a central channel. This channel provides the conduit for phage DNA entry and exit. gp4 is dodecameric and gp10 is hexameric, as indicated in the cryoEM map. Thus, the second symmetry transition occurs between gp4 and gp10. The third symmetry transition takes place where the gp26 trimer is attached to the hexameric gp10. It forms a plug at the distal opening of the tail tube to prevent the packaged DNA from leaking. The six copies of trimeric tailspikes bind to the interface of gp4 and gp10 through its N-terminal domain. The C-terminal receptor-binding domain of the tailspike recognizes the O-antigenic repeat units of lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the host cell. The needle formed by gp26 most likely penetrates the outer membrane to reach the peptidoglycan layer, and then undergoes major conformational changes such as being dislodged from gp10 driven by the force created by tailspike-receptor binding. This opens the channel, and a signal is generated and relayed through gp10, gp4 and the portal into the internal head, and thus triggers a series molecular events leading to phage DNA translocation and/or delivery of minor phage proteins in some phages such as P22 and T7 (Israel, 1977; Strauss and King, 1984; Molineux, 2001).",

Inspection of the tilt series assisted manual building of an initial model by addition of six cylindrical density and a small spherical density to the portal reconstruction. In this initial model, one end of the cylindrical density was in close proximity to the lower part of the wing domain of the portal and the other end was slightly pointed outward so that the long axes of the cylinders and the portal channel form an angle of 15\u00b0. The small spherical density was placed next to the bottom opening of the portal. An initial data set of 3087 particles was used to calculate a preliminary reconstruction, which gave rise to an elongated needle-like density for the originally spherical one and therefore served as a validation for the reconstruction. A total of 17 517 particles were boxed from tilted micrographs into a 160 \u00d7 160 dimension with a pixel size of 4.2 \u00c5. A reconstruction was calculated and refined using all the data and imposing C6 symmetry. In order to avoid possible inaccuracy in the length of the gp26 needle arising from saturated density in top or bottom views, the particles from untilted micrographs were excluded from the reconstruction. The gp26 needle in the reconstruction computed from all data was removed. With such an initial model and 11 329 particles from tilted micrographs, a new reconstruction was calculated and refined.
