While the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations meet at their annual G8 summit to discuss the global state of affairs, a wide variety of organizations and protesters meet in parallel to decry what they see as the negative effects of globalization. Notwith-standing these protests, whether one sees globalization as a tool to overcome poverty, hunger and disease in the world or whether one feels threatened by its consequences, one thing is certain: globalization is here to stay. Often narrowly defined as the increasing integration of the world's economies, globalization is in reality a powerful development that presents new challenges at the beginning of this millennium.",

How-ever defined, this term has many dimensions, including economic, technological, political, social, scientific and cultural aspects. The links between globalization and health are complex and globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect health in myriad ways. Its consequences can be either direct, at the level of whole populations, individuals and healthcare delivery systems, or indirect, through the economy and other factors, such as education, sanitation and water supply (Woodward et al, 2001). Given the enormous complexity and breadth of the issues, our article cannot hope to cover the entire range of topics that link globalization to health. Instead, we focus on those risks to health and health care that are related to central aspects of the globalization process, namely trade, travel and exchange of information.",

These countries are at particular risk, as industrialized countries increasingly ban cigarette advertisements and tobacco companies intensively target people in poorer nations as potential customers. The high incidence of smoking among children and adolescents, and the disturbingly low age of initiation, raise additional concerns (Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collaborative Group, 2002).",

There is a strong relationship between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis, some cancers, and most causes of injuries and violence, although minimal amounts of alcohol are sufficient to reduce the risk of CVD (Beaglehole & Yach, 2003).The spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has ... contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foods",

This rapid increase again illustrates the globalized risks for conditions that are mainly caused by diet, even in less developed countries that have coexistent under-nutrition. There were 151 million cases of diabetes worldwide in 2001, and this is estimated to increase by 46% to 221 million cases in 2010, with the steepest growth in the developing world (Zimmet et al, 2001). The same holds true for obesity (Shell, 2001). Of course, not all of this is globalization's fault\u2014these chronic or 'lifestyle' diseases are mainly caused by personal choice, that is, a sedentary lifestyle, the use of tobacco and a fat- and sugar-rich diet. Nevertheless, a key factor has been the unprecedented increase in the global food trade, and its domination by large transnational companies that have developed global brand names and aggressive marketing strategies adapted to local situations (Chopra et al, 2002). The spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has been especially rapid in the developing world during the past two or three decades and has contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foods. It is revealing that only a short period after their introduction on the Chinese market, 65%, 42% and 40% of consumers in China recognized the brands Coca Cola, Pepsi and Nestl\u00e9, respectively (Lang, 2001).",

In this sense, the implementation of TRIPS can be seen as exacerbating health risks. Trade and movement of infected cattle and poultry across national borders may also have contributed to recent outbreaks of mad cow disease in the Northern hemisphere and avian influenza in Asia.TRIPS [WTO's agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] threatens to limit and undermine access to new medicines, especially to poor populations living in the developing world",

Second, patients can travel abroad to receive health care or use certain facilities\u2014the UK government recently allowed UK patients to seek treatment in the European Economic Area (Lowson et al, 2002). Other countries, including developing ones such as Cuba and India, openly advertise to attract foreign patients to their clinics and hospitals. Third, health services themselves have become an industry that attracts foreign investments. Several transnational companies from developed and developing countries have already created commercial health services through the purchase and establishment of hospitals (Chanda, 2002). Fourth, the international movement of health personnel across borders has become a significant component of the trade in health services and has attracted considerable attention in the scientific and lay press.",

The liberalization of the airline industry in many countries has made air travel affordable for more and more people around the world, which has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of global air travel. Sutherst (2004) estimated that about one million people travel internationally every day and a similar number travel between developed and developing countries each week. Another recent report (Gossling, 2002) put the number of global tourist arrivals per year at 700 million. Far-reaching air travel, aided by improvements in aircraft technology that allow longer nonstop flights, facilitates the spread of communicable diseases. It is entirely possible that a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 12\u201315 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease, aiding its spread, perhaps into vulnerable, non-immune populations. The recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the best contemporary example of the rapid spread of a hitherto unknown and virulent viral pathogen through travel of infected humans (Figs 2, 3 and 4). SARS was first recognized in February 2003 in Vietnam where cases of atypical pneumonia with an unknown cause began to appear. By the first week of May 2003, 30 countries on six continents had reported a total of more than 7,000 probable cases with more than 500 deaths (WHO, 2003a)....a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 12\u201315 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease...",

Should the full sequence of the anthrax bacillus or smallpox virus and other virulent pathogens be published if this data could be used to develop biological weapons? Another example is the development of an improved virus to kill mice that has created fears that the enhanced virus could be used for bioterrorism (Finkel, 2001).

The policies recommend price and tax measures, protection from exposure to second-hand smoke, and regulation and disclosure of the contents of tobacco products. Packaging and labelling, advertising, promotion and sponsorship are also regulated, as are tobacco dependence and cessation measures, illicit trade, sales to and by minors, and liability (Hammond & Assunta, 2003). In May 2003, the final draft of the FCTC was adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly. The treaty has been open for signature since June 2003 and will enter into force once it has been ratified by 40 parties. As of 1 July 2004, 167 countries and the European Community have signed the FCTC and 24 have ratified it, up from nine in March\u2014impressive progress in just four months. The most recent public smoking bans in places such as New York City, Ireland and Norway are clearly further important steps towards protecting public health from the perils of tobacco smoke.",

These regulations were drafted to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference to world traffic.

These developments clearly lead to an increase in health risks either directly or indirectly, particularly in the developing world where the benefits of globalization are often offset by its adverse effects. More insidiously, the threat of misuse of globalized information for bioterrorism purposes is becoming a serious concern for many governments. International organizations can have an important role in minimizing such risks through regulations, policy recommendations, advocacy and promoting dialogue among interested parties. In addition, to reap the benefits of globalization, we need novel approaches to international cooperation that place national self-interest in the context of global mutual interest and, in this way, promote international cooperation and goodwill (Frenk & Gomez-Dantes, 2002).",
