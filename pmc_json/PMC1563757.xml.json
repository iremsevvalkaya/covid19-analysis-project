A search of the possible interhelical interactions in the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) was performed using a total of 17 homologs of SARS-CoV E, present in other viruses. We showed that only three homooligomeric models had been conserved by evolution of the viruses: a dimer, a trimer, and two similar pentamers. Due to the special nature of our simulation, totally independent from experimental measurements, and only dependent on the disturbing effect of conservative mutations on non native models, we predicted (12) that all these oligomers should be found in vivo.",

Clearly, of these oligomeric forms, only a pentamer is consistent with the formation of a pore that could account for the ion channel behavior observed in previous reports (9), but at present the oligomeric form of protein E, and ETM, in lipid bilayers is not yet known.",

Specifically, we have synthesized ETM introducing a labeled carbonyl (13C=18O) (14) at various positions (15), for a total of nine residues along the ETM sequence. We have then determined the orientation in space of these labeled peptidic carbonyl groups using the theory of site specific infrared dichroism (SSID) (16). Like any orientational technique, SSID has certain limitations. First, it requires a certain order of the sample, and therefore is not applicable to proteins in solution. Also, it requires a known periodicity in the sample, which is found in \u03b1-helical segments. Finally, the requirement for discrimination between neighboring peptide carbonyl orientations makes it unsuitable when \u03b1-helices are either completely parallel or perpendicular to the membrane normal. SSID is therefore ideal to study TMH bundles, where all the above conditions are met (14,15,17).",

The peptides were cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and lyophilized. The lyophilized peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (12). Lyophilization was performed always in the presence of HCl (typically at an approximate molar ratio 20:1, HCl/peptide) to avoid the formation of peptide-TFA adducts; consequently, the typical TFA band at \u223c1685 cm\u22121 was not observed in the amide I region. Peptide purity was further confirmed by mass spectrometry. During the synthesis of ETM, an amino acid bearing a 13C=18O carbonyl group was introduced at a specific position (Fig. 1 B, open circles). A mutation was introduced in two of the peptides, N15A and F23A (Fig. 1 B, residues underlined). In the first case (N15A), this was done to observe if Asn substitution had a critical destabilizing effect on the oligomers, because Asn-Asn interactions were predicted to be present in all evolutionarily conserved oligomeric models (12). The second mutation, F23A, was assumed to be critical in view of its suggested central role in the formation of a putative palindromic helical hairpin (23).",

The \u201csmiles\u201d for different residues were found to intersect (i.e., converged to a solution) for the pairs 17/18 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0), 18/19 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0), 19/21 (\u0394\u03c9 = 200\u00b0), 21/22 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0), 22/23 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0), 23/24 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0) and 27/28 (\u0394\u03c9 = 100\u00b0). More importantly, Table 2 shows that using these \u0394\u03c9, expected for a canonical \u03b1-helix, the \u03c9-values are consistent with the pentamer B oligomer obtained previously using global search molecular dynamics (12), except for \u03c927 and \u03c928, which are closer to pentamer A than to pentamer B. The \u0394\u03c9 between 24 and 27 is therefore 390\u00b0 (Fig. 4 J), not 300\u00b0. Indeed, when we combined 24 and 27 assuming \u0394\u03c9 = 300\u00b0 (not shown) \u03c924 was 40\u00b0, which is not consistent with the value \u03c924 = \u221270\u00b0, obtained with the pair 23/24. The reason for the inconsistency may be a slight bend from residues 24 to 27, and exemplifies the need to use consecutive residues in these calculations. Slices through a pentamer in agreement with these observations are represented (Fig. 4, L\u2013Q).",

This suggests that this mutation not only does not perturb the oligomeric forms present in SDS (see Fig. 2) but also does not alter significantly the structure of the oligomer in lipid bilayers. Similarly, our results show that the substitution F23A did not affect the orientation of the \u03b1-helices: when the dichroic data from the label introduced at position A23 (Fig. 1 B, asterisks) was combined with V24 or A22, a solution was found which was consistent with the \u03c9-values expected for the pentameric B model. Together with the electrophoresis results, which show that none of the oligomeric forms are affected by mutation F23A (Fig. 2), this suggests that F23 does not play any essential role in either maintaining the oligomeric structure or in defining a particular topology.",

To confirm this topology, we labeled ETM with Phe-CN, a nitrile derivatized phenylalanine, at these three positions (see Fig. 1 B, solid dots). The rationale for this experiment is provided by the sensitivity of the C\u2261N stretching vibration of this nitrile derivatized side chain to the hydration and polarity of the environment (35,36). If the side chain is fully hydrated, the band is centered at 2235 cm\u22121 in contrast, when inserted deep in phospholipid bilayers, this band shifts to lower wavenumbers, at 2229 cm\u22121, and becomes narrower (35). Fig. 5 shows the C\u2261N stretching vibration of the three nitrile derivatized amino acids when ETM is reconstituted in DMPC lipid bilayers. Clearly, for all three Phe residues, the band is centered at \u223c2230 cm\u22121. This indicates a generally hydrophobic and dehydrated environment, consistent with these Phe residues being deeply buried in the lipid bilayer.",

This modification, which we also used in a previous report (12) was made to improve solubility and purification (37). It has been demonstrated (38,39) for various TM oligomers, e.g., monomeric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), dimeric glycophorin A (GpA), and tetrameric M2 from Influenza A, that even with up to four flanking lysines at each C- and N-termini, oligomerization is not affected during SDS PAGE electrophoresis. Also, electrophoretic mobility has been reported to be reduced \u223c30% when three lysines are added at each terminus (38). In this work, with only two lysines on each side, the error in molecular weight estimation should not be higher than 20%. In support that a pentameric form of whole E protein is also present in SDS, we show bands consistent with pentamers (\u223c46 kDa), along with monomers (\u223c9 kDa) and some dimers (\u223c17 kDa) of E protein when expressed in E. coli in reducing conditions. In a previous work (8) only monomers (\u223c9 kDa), dimers (\u223c18 kDa), and trimers (\u223c27 kDa) were observed, but only under nonreducing conditions. We are unable to explain these variations in the oligomeric species observed, but they may be related to the complex functionality of SARS- CoV E. In any case, the band at (\u223c46 kDa) cannot be interpreted as being trimers, because these were observed previously at \u223c27 kDa (8). Incidentally, a pentameric homooligomer has also been observed in other similarly sized viral membrane proteins, e.g., the small (63 residues) hydrophobic protein in the respiratory syncytial virus (40,41). It is possible therefore that these two proteins perform similar functions. In this respect, E protein has been found to induce in vivo permeabilization of biological membranes to bulky molecules such as o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and hygromycin B (8). Although a pentameric porelike structure cannot explain permeabilization to these big molecules, it can explain the permeability to cations observed in an in vitro system (9).",

Clearly, the model pentamer B is not consistent with an open channel (the diameter of naked Na+ or Ca2+ is \u223c2 \u00c5, and that of K+ is even larger, 2.66 \u00c5). We note that similar constriction diameters have been found for other channels in a closed state, e.g., 1 \u00c5 in KirBac (42), a bacterial homolog of mammalian inward rectifier K channels. Considering the model A orientation from residues 24\u201327 however, the channel appears more open. Our experimental data can only be explained by a bend of the \u03b1-helices around residues 25\u201327, with residues 17\u201324 consistent with pentamer B and 24 onward consistent with pentamer A. The only partial consistency with the computational models may be explained by the fact that during the simulations of ETM (12) we restrained the helix tilt to a particular value, and effects such as bends or kinks, if existed in the native structure, were not accounted for. The result of this simplistic assumption may have been that, instead of a single pentameric model, two different models were obtained with only a partially correct orientation in different parts of the sequence. This conclusion is supported by the fact that none of these two models contained all the lowest energy structures for the 17 sequences analyzed, although most of them (16) were in agreement with model A and only 1 (PHEV) with model B.",

We also note that if the helix tilt determined previously without any isotopic label (23) was \u22646\u00b0, we should be unable to calculate \u03c9-angles for the different residues, because the transition dipole moment of any peptidic C=O bond would have a similar orientation relative to the z axis. In other words, SSID can only provide orientational information if the tilt is at least 10\u00b0. In this work, the helix tilt found is in the range 20\u201330\u00b0.

It is possible that the presence of these positively charged lysines favors a transmembrane topology, and not a hairpin. In any case, the pentameric form we report is unlikely to be an artifact, because these TM interactions and oligomeric size are consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete SARS-CoV E polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity. Clearly, more than one topology is possible for ETM, especially considering the range of attributed roles for this small protein.",
