This represented 93% of all admissions for acute wheezing during the study period. Children who had evidence of cardiopulmonary disease or immunosuppression were excluded. The control subjects included 133 age-matched and gender-matched hospitalized children without wheezing. They were enrolled during the same season of each matched wheezing subject. Demographic information was obtained from parent-administered questionnaires and hospital charts. The Human Investigation Committee at the University of Virginia approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent was obtained from older children.",

In addition, nucleic acids extracted from the samples had been tested previously by RT-PCR for rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV, and by PCR for adenovirus.1 Metapneumovirus testing was performed by a real-time RT-PCR assay on a Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, Calif) using primers and probe for the N gene5 with the Quantitect RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). The probe was altered slightly, with BHQ-3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) substituted for 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine as the 3\u2032 fluorescent quencher. These primers and probe have been shown to detect all 4 genetic lineages of hMPV, and the limit of detection in our assay was 50 copies of viral genome per reaction.",

Instead, rhinovirus was the dominant pathogen associated with severe exacerbations, which has also been observed in other studies of children hospitalized for wheezing.7 In addition, the large majority (at least 80%) of the wheezing children age 3 years and older who were hospitalized in Virginia had striking atopic characteristics.1\n",
